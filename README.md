Demonstrates the usage of leaflet.shapefile 
=================

This is a demonstration of the usage of [leaflet.shapefile](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/). The demo given there shows how a file which is already present on the server  can be displayed on a Leaflet map. 

My requirement was allowing a user to upload a shapefile (i.e a Zip file containg the individual files), and display that on the map. I could not find a short and easy demo of that, so I made this.
